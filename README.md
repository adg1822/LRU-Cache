# Chatlist
* Implemented Least Recently Used(LRU) cache using Linked List and HashMap.It provides insertion, deletion, and searching in constant time.
* When a message from a new chat arrives, it will be inserted at the top of the chat list. If the message is from an existing conversation, then it will update the chat position to the top.
* Improved performance time as compared to array implementation of LRU cache.
